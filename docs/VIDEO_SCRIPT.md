# SafeSpace Salone - Video Script

**Total Duration:** ~3 minutes
**Instructions:** Read slowly and clearly. Pause between sections. Each section tells you which screenshot to show.

---

## SECTION 1: The Hook (0:00 - 0:25)
**Screenshot:** App logo or homepage

> In Sierra Leone, talking about mental health can cost you everything.
>
> Your reputation. Your relationships. Your place in the community.
>
> So people stay silent. They suffer alone. And too often... that silence becomes unbearable.
>
> But what if there was a safe place to talk? A place where no one knows your name... but someone still cares?

---

## SECTION 2: The Problem (0:25 - 0:55)
**Screenshot:** Homepage with the three icons (Anonymous, Free Chat, Real Support)

> Here's the reality.
>
> Sierra Leone has one of the highest rates of mental health challenges in West Africa.
>
> Years of civil war, the Ebola crisis, and economic hardship have left deep scars.
>
> Yet there are fewer than five psychiatrists for over eight million people.
>
> Mental health services are concentrated in Freetown, leaving rural communities with almost nothing.
>
> And even when help exists, stigma keeps people away.
>
> The result? People who desperately need support... never ask for it.

## SECTION 3: Introducing SafeSpace (0:55 - 1:30)
**Screenshots:** Show each screen as mentioned

> That's why we built SafeSpace Salone.
>
> A free, anonymous mental health support app designed specifically for Sierra Leoneans.

**Screenshot:** Signup page with avatar selection

> No real names. No photos. No judgment.
>
> Just a safe space to finally talk.
>
> When you sign up, you choose an avatar and create a simple four-digit PIN. That's it. Your identity stays completely hidden.

**Screenshot:** Topics selection page

> Then you select what you're struggling with — anxiety, depression, relationships, trauma — and you're matched with a trained counselor who specializes in exactly what you need.

**Screenshot:** Chat interface

> You can send text messages, or if typing feels too hard, just send a voice note. Whatever feels right for you.

## SECTION 4: How It Works (1:30 - 2:15)
**Screenshots:** Show each screen as mentioned

**Screenshot:** Counselor dashboard

> On the other side, verified counselors see conversations that match their expertise.
>
> They accept patients, provide real support, and guide them through their challenges.

**Screenshot:** Chat with read receipts or online status

> The app shows when messages are read, when your counselor is online, and keeps your conversation history secure.

**Screenshot:** Offline indicator or mobile view

> And because we know internet in Sierra Leone isn't always reliable — SafeSpace works offline too.
>
> Your messages save locally and send automatically when you reconnect.

**Screenshot:** Phone showing the app installed

> It works on any phone. No app store needed. Just open the link and start talking.

## SECTION 5: The Impact (2:15 - 2:45)
**Screenshot:** Homepage with features (Anonymous, Free Chat, Real Support)

> SafeSpace Salone removes every barrier that keeps Sierra Leoneans from getting help.
>
> No travel. No cost. No stigma. No fear.
>
> Just a person who's hurting... and someone ready to listen.
>
> Because healing shouldn't require courage. It should just require a safe space.

---

## SECTION 6: Closing (2:45 - 3:00)
**Screenshot:** Homepage with both buttons visible

> SafeSpace Salone.
>
> Anonymous. Private. Always here.
>
> Because your identity can stay hidden... but your feelings matter.

*(Pause)*

> Get support today. Or join us as a counselor... and help someone find their voice.

Good luck with your video!
